        <p>
            Max J. is a 3D Artist born 1995 in Saxony, Germany. 
            His work focuses procedural physical simulations, motion design and contemporary art. 
            <!-- I started modeling and animating with Autodesk 3Ds Max and Maya at the age of 12. 
            I continued creating my first visuals, covers, intros and advertising in Cinema4D together with the use of After Effects.
            After working for a small marketing agency and a few visualization jobs in Saxony while studying Media-Informatics and interactive Entertainment i decided in 2018 to focus on more detailed designs, which were only able with Plugins in C4D and third-party-software. 
            Learning the powerful tool houdini in 2018 sensitized me for procedural content creation.-->
